NAME
     tt - run ThoughtTreasure

SYNOPSIS
     tt [-a] [-l] [-c cmd] [-f file] [-g langs] [-d dialects]

OPTIONS
     -a          Use the more memory-intensive analogical morphology
                 instead of the default algorithmic morphology.

     -l          Do not load the ThoughtTreasure database.

     -c cmd      After the database is loaded (if it is loaded), execute
                 the specified ThoughtTreasure shell command.

     -f file     After the database is loaded (if it is loaded), execute
                 ThoughtTreasure shell commands in the specified file.

     -g langs    Start ThoughtTreasure for the specified languages.

     -d dialects Start ThoughtTreasure for the specified dialects.

                 (By default ThoughtTreasure is started for English only.
                 This means it does not load any French lexical entries.
                 To start ThoughtTreasure for English and French, do:
                 tt -g zy -d ?Àgç)
