<li><b>Why my configed servlet not shown in the unload servlets dialog box</b>
    Please note the UI is only intended to show the servlets been used,
    not the all the servlets that are configed and mapped.  To unmap a servlet,
    use cofnig servlet (http://localhost/srvConfig/) instead.

<ul>
<li><b>How to use the config servlet?</b><br><br>
        <UL>
        Start the server and connect to http://localhost/, click on the first link, 'Config the Server'.
        Enter admin for both username and password.  After login click on the 'Edit user list' link
        and change the pass word for admin.<br>
        If you don't want to use the config servlet anymore, you can disable it by remove the srvConfig.war
        file from wars/ directory, then either restart the server or click on the <b>Reload Wars</b> button on the UI.

    First, run <font color=#00ff00>jvmInvoker.exe -i</font> to install the service.
    Then use NT control services applet to start the "Bajie Http Web Server" service.<br>
    NOTE:  You must either copy the jvm.dll (found at your jdk bin/hotspot directory) to 
    the directory where jvmInvoker is installed, or your JDK must be installed instead of
    just copied (so the registory values can be found).  The code for getting the registry
    values is copied from <a href="http://www.kcmultimedia.com/javaserv/">KC Multimedia</a>, 
    and the source is available at <a href="service.cpp">service.cpp</a> and

<li><a name="HowToAddServlets"><b>How to add servlets?</b></a><br><br>       
       First, drop your servlet in the server's classpath (you can set it from config servlet or by edit the config/jzHttpSrv.properties file).
       <br> By default <b>htdocs/WEB-INF/classes</b> and <b>servlets/</b> directory are in classpath. (You can find the directory where you extract the server).  So drop your servlet class files in those directory.
       If your servlet is a jar, you can drop it in either <b>lib/</b> or
       <b>htdocs/WEB-INF/lib</b> directory, where all *.jar file will be automaticaly added in server classpath.  Or you can add it to server classpath (to change server classpath, you can either manuly edit htodcs/WEB-INF/web.xml file and restart the server, or use config servlet http://localhost/srvConfig and click on <i>edit webapp config</i> link and edit it there).
	<br>If you have parameters for your servlet, put them in a files named servletClassName.params.properties.   For example, if you wrote a servlet counter.class, then 
put your servlet params as key=val in counter.params.properties, in the same place as counter.class.
	<br>Now use your browser go to http://localhost/servlet/ServletClassName  and your servlet will be in action (example, if your servlet is counter.class, then use http://localhost/servlet/counter  and your servlet will be invoked).
	<br> If you wish to map your servlet to a different url, then use the following step:
       <br>Use your browser and connect to:
       <br>http://localhost/srvConfig/ , this will open the config servlet.  
       <br>Click <b>Edit Servlets</b> , which is on the top of the screen.
        It will show you
        a list of servlet alias.  To automatically find and add new servlets, click on the
        <b>Show auto alias action</b> button, this will go to a screen show all the servlets
        in the servlets/ directory.  Select the servlets you want to add by check the check box on the left and
        change the alias name if you want to, then click on the <b>submit</b> button.<br>
         
        The servlet can be invoke by: http://localhost/servlet/servletAliasName.
    
       You can also change the servlet mapping so the servlet request url can be anything by either use the config servlet or
       edit the WEB-INF/web.xml file (just as webapp).<br><br>
	With the server class path feature, you can also add specical path for special
        classes.  For example, you can add filters/ directory in your classpath and only put
	filter classes in that directory.<br><br>

	To edit the server classpath, use config servlet http://localhost/srvConfig/
	, login using admin/admin and click on the "<b>Edit WebApp Config</b>" button
	on top right corner of the screen, and append/delete classpath in the
	"Set Server Class Path" box.


<br><br>
Note:  If you jar your servlet, and you wish to use classname.params.properties file to provide parameters, then you need to jar the file with your classes.

<li>  <b>How to add .war files?</b><br>
      <br>
      There are 2 ways to add .war files.  <br>
      <ul>
      <li>Put your .war files in wars/ directory, and start the server.  If the server
          is already started, click on the 'Reload Wars' button.  The .war file will be
          listed with war context name same as the .war file name.  For example, if your
          .war file is named tagTest.war, you can access it via http://localhost/tagTest/......<br>
      <li>If you want to give your war context other name then the .war file name, then put
          the .war file in any directory under the install root, and edit the config/war.properties file and
          add /yourContext/=path/yourWarFileName.war <br>
          you can use tagtest.war in wap.properties as an example.
      </ul>

<li><a name="PreventAUTOServletAliasMapping"><b>How to prevent server automatically map servlet alias 
to /servlet/ServletAlias?</b></a>
<ul>
This feature is in versions 0.94z+. I don't have time to update the documents yet, 
another config option is available to 
set if the server automatically map servlets to URL mapping (if servlet will be mapped to
/servlet/serveltAlias).  It is AUTOADDSERVLETMAPPING=true/false in config/jzHttpSrv.properties.
<br><br>
	<ul>
	Historic note ;-)   Long long time ago, the server automatically pick up servlets classes in servlets/ directory.
	People can drop their classes in there and access their servlet via http://host/servlet/ServletName directly without
	any config.  However later on for speed and expandablity, web.xml file is used to map url and servlet, and config servlet
	is used to automatically give servlet a name and map it to a url.  To ensure a smooth transition, any servlet that is
	given a alias is automatically mapped to /servlet/servletAlias.  You can now disable it by set the propertie.
	</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> <b>How was the .tld file for jsp located?</b>

     <br>
     <ul>
        The search order for .tld files are:
        <li>  If the .jsp file request the tld is in a war, then the WAR's web.xml file is searched for a matching
             <taglib-location> for the uri.  If match found,  use the <taglib-location> value as the uri.  <br>
              If no match found, the engine will try to find the uri with in the WAR file, related to the root of the WAR.
              (So if the tld is in WEB-INF/tlds/test.tld, the request uri should be WEB-INF/tlds/test.tld, with or with our a leading '/').<br>
              If the uri ends with ".jar" extension, the engine will search for META-INF/taglib.tld as the tld file.
              For example, if the request uri is /WEB-INF/lib/tag.jar, then the engine will search for META-INF/taglib.tld in 
              /WEB-INF/lib/tag.jar.  
              <br>If the above method failed, then the engine will try to locate the tld as if the jsp is not in a WAR (see step below).
        <li>  If the .jsp file is not in a war, the engine will try to find the matching <taglib-location> in the common web.xml file
              (htdocs/WEB-INF/web.xml).  If match found, then the engine will try to open it as a file, related to webroot (related to htdocs directory).
              If no match found, and the uri starts with http:// or file://, then the engine will open a URL to it.  Otherwise
              the engine will test if the request uri is a file.  If the request uri is a file with path related to the htdocs/ directory, the engine
              will open it.  If all the above failed, the engine will search for htdocs/WEB-INF/classes directory for the file and look into
              all .jar files in htdocs/WEB-INF/lib directory for the file.  For example, if the request uri is test/test.tld, and htdocs/WEB-INF/lib/test.jar
              contains test/test.tld, the engine will find it and use it.
        <li>  Note: I think the best way to store and use a .tld file is, jar the .tld file
              with other beans, tags that used by the jsp file in one jar (name the tld file /META-INF/taglib.tld in the jar).
              And put it in WEB-INF/lib directory.  In the jsp or in the web.xml taglib mapping, set the value to /WEB-INF/lib/yourlibjar.jar. (yourlibjar.jar is the jar with all the related classes).
              This way deploy jsps and the taglib is very easy, just 2 simple drop of file and everything will be in place.

     </ul>
</ul>


<ul>
<li> <b>Where to put .jsp files?  Where do I put bean classes for jsp files?</b>

     <br>
     <ul>
     <li>  Put .jsp files anywhere under the htdocs/ directory except the WEB-INF/ directory.
     <li>  put bean classes in WEB-INF/classes directory, and if beans is jared, put in WEB-INF/lib directory.
           It is the same for .war files and taglib files.
           <br>
           If you jar your taglib, you can either put the .tld file in WEB-INF/classes directory or
           jar it with your taglib.  However if you jar them, make sure they got different names or different
           pathes.

     </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>How to set autoreload for servlets and .war files?  </b><br>
  <ul>
   Open your browser and connect to:
       http://localhost/srvConfig/, and edit your current server.  Servlet  autoreload 
and other server properties can be set there.  Make sure you save server properties before exit.

The server will compare to see if servlet class file's date is newer before treating a 
request that access the servlet.  If it is newer the server will unload the servlet and 
load the new version.
<br>NOTE: if the classes is not in a jar file, autoreload can be slow because the server checks all loaded classes
files in the classes' path to see if they are out of date.  
<br>NOTE: If you change from not autoreload to autoreload without restart, use 'Reload classpath' button to ensure the server get all
the class files registered.  Othewise auto reload may not work.
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<b>CGI support</b><br>
<ul>
The default CGI directory is .\cgi\bin\ , changed the PERLEXECLOC property in 
config/jzHttpSrv.properties to set the perl interperter.
If that property is not set, all CGI are supposed to be executables.
<br>A request of form http://hostname/cgi/bin/XXXX will execute the XXXX cgi script.
The server checks to make sure XXXX exists in cgi\bin\ directory before execute it.
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<b> <a name="SSL_setup">HTTPS support </b><br>
<ul>
jzHttpSrv has build in support for sun's JSSE.  For legal reasons, the jar files are not 
included.  If you want, go to java.sun.com to download JSSE (as long as you are in US, you can do this)
, and add the jars in the classpath.
Once you downloaded the zip file, unzip it and find the 3 jar files, jsse.jar, jcert.jar and jssl.jar.
put them in the same directory with jzHttpSrv.jar, then go to that directory and type:
java -cp jsse.jar;jcert.jar;jssl.jar;jzHttpSrv.jar jzHttpSrv
<br>
You can put the jars in the JDKPATH/jre/lib/ext directory so you can start the server the
normal way.

<br>
<br> With version 0.95h, you can start server with the 'servers' menu.  After the server list
dialog popup, click on 'add server' button.  Check the 'ssl' check box, and select the testkeys file (which is supplied by sun.  If you have a key, use your key instead).  The password for testkeys is 'passphrase'.

<b><a name=Customized_logging>Customized logging is REMOVED!!</b>
(Added since version 0.30c, removed after version 0.94z.  Use filters for customized logging.)
</ul>

<ul>
<a name="Customizable_error_page"><b>Customizable error page</b>
<ul>
    You can specify which html page, jsp page or servlet to involve when a error is encountered. 
    Use the config servlet, click on <b>Edit WebApp Config</b> button, and at the bottom of the new page,
    you can map specific error code or exception to the html, jsp or servlet.
    If you wish to use a servlet, you must use put its url mapping to the <i>Error Page Location</i> box.
    
    <br>
    The message is passed to the jsp or servlet via:
      request Attribute "javax.servlet.error.message" -> exception message.    
    See htdocs/errorReport.jsp for example.
</ul>
</ul> 
   
<ul>
<b>  Browsers with no cookie support</b>
<ul>
    
    <li> For simple GET or POST operation: If browser do not support cookies, 
    you must embedded the sessionid in forms or URL.  
    The name must be "jsessionid" (according sun spec) or
    classpath.  The server will pick it up automatically.  
    See servlets/test/NoCookieSession.java for example

    <li> For POST with multipart/form-data
    com.BajieSoft.HttpSrv.gzHttpServletRequest is the under line implemention of 
    HttpServletRequest.  Usually you don't need to use setSessionID() function. 
    But when you are doing POST with multipart/form-data and need to deal with browsers 
    with no cookie support, you need to embedded the server id as above, and make sure it is 
    the first item in the form.   After parse it out, cast your HttpServletRequest to 
    com.BajieSoft.HttpSrv.gzHttpServletRequest and use the setSessionID function to set the 
    session id.  When compile make sure add jzHttpSrv.jar to classpath.
</ul>
</ul>

<b><a name="SetAutoReloadOff">How to set auto servlet reload on or off?</b><br><br>
<ul>
  Auto servlet reload is by default on.  With auto servlet reload on, the server automatically reload updated servlet, war or jsp files when needed without your 
attension.  It is ideal in development mode because you can fix a bug in your servlet and recompile, or for war recompile and jar it, then just use the browser the connect the it as if nothing happened, the server will automatically load the new one.  
  <br>However, the auto reload make the server run slow, espically for servlets, it is very slow.  To turn it off, connect to 
<a href="http://localhost/srvConfig">http://localhost/srvConfig</a> (you may need to specify the port if you use a non-default port).  Login in with admin/admin.  Click on
"Edit common server properties" on top left of the screen, Set "Set Auto Servlet reload " to off and make sure click on the "Save" button.

                                           automatically reloaded if source changed.
                                           Turn it on in development mode is a very good idea
                                           since you don't need to restart the server every
                                           time you modified your servlet, war or jsp.
                                           Turn it off can make the server a little faster.

            The server will not find the servlet if you specifi a url without the trailing '/'.
