<br><b>Install:</b><br><br>
Unzip httpsrv.zip to a directory of your choice. 
Edit config/jzHttpSrv.properties to configure your webserver (you can leave it as is)<br>
You need JDK1.1.6 and above or Microsoft's JVM (jview).  
Microsoft's JVM comes with Internet explorer 5.0.  However, to use JSP features, 
You need to make sure jdk1.2's javac is in the path. <br><br>

You can start the http server by:<br>
<ul>
<li> Jdk1.2 on Windows: double click on jzHttpSrv.jar<br>
<li> Jdk1.2 on other platforms: type "java -jar jzHttpSrv.jar" 
<li> To start the server in console, use java -jar jzHttpSrv.jar -noui
<li> To start the server in console and enable to terminate it by typing a enter, use
java -jar jzHttpSrv.jar -noui -con
for 1.1x JVMs:<br>
<li> for GUI:
<li> type: java -cp .;jzHttpSrv.jar com.BajieSoft.HttpSrv.startGUI 
<li> (Windows only) type: jview -cp .;jzHttpSrv.jar com.BajieSoft.HttpSrv.startGUI
<li> To start the console version:
<li> type: java -cp .;jzHttpSrv.jar com.BajieSoft.HttpSrv.jzHttpSrv
<li> (Windows only) type: jview -cp .;jzHttpSrv.jar com.BajieSoft.HttpSrv.jzHttpSrv
<li> <b> For UNIX or Linux, replace the ';' with ':'.</b>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
I haven't tried it on Mac yet, but the server should work on all platforms that supports
java.  If you have tried it on Mac, please let me know the install process.  Thanks!

<br>
<br>
<b>Note: Afte start the server, please connect to http://localhost/
and click on the first link (http://localhost/srvConfig/), which starts the config servlet. 
The login name is admin, password is also admin.  Change your password there.
</b>
<br>
After change your password, click on "Edit Common Properties" (at upper left) and
change <b>Set perl interpreter location</b> to enable perl. 
Then change <b>JSP compile string</b>, replace javac to full path to the java compiler (example, c:\jdk1.x\bin\javac) on your machine
so the jsp compiler know where to find java compiler.
